This is an implementation of the [Wang-Landau Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_and_Landau_algorithm) for analyzing the Density of States for artificail neural networks. 
The code was developed as part of the Computational Statistical Mechanics Lab in my physics Bachelors course at the university of Vienna under the supervision of Univ.-Prof. Mag. Dr. Christoph Dellago. 

This method for connecting the Density of States with artificial neural net-
works has been proposed by [Mele et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18683) in their 2024 paper. The goal
of this project was to reproduce and compare these findings.
